LISNoC is a free Network-on-Chip implementation, mainly for academic
or teaching purposes, but freely available for any use under the LGPL
license. It is implemented in Verilog.

It is a straight forward implementation with a strong focus on
easiness to understand the code and extendability.

Main features:

* Virtual channel support
* Flexible router configuration (number of input ports, number of output ports,..)
* Wormhole routing, strict ordering
* Round-robin arbitration for link multiplexing
	
We only finished documentation roughly, in case of questions, please

## Getting Started

The easiest to get started is to understand the documentation on the
right and do some first tests with the testbenches.
